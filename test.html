<h2>Canada and IATI</h2>
<p>The former Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) <a href="/acdi-cida/acdi-cida.nsf/eng/NAT-11281180-LX3">joined IATI</a> in November 2011, underscoring its commitment to being more transparent.</p>

<p>In October 2012, CIDA released its first set of quarterly data files compatible with the IATI standard. <a href="http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/updates/news/canada-publish-iati/">CIDA's actions won praise</a> from the non-governmental organization <em>Publish What You Fund</em>: "CIDA's publication&#8212;including important results information&#8212;is the first of its kind from a North American government institution. It is also the first IATI data to be published bilingually in French and English."</p>
<p>In December 2012, CIDA released its <a href="/acdi-cida/acdi-cida.nsf/eng/CAR-1122151526-RRQ">implementation schedule for the IATI standard</a>, which outlined how and when CIDA planned to release more information as part of its commitment to IATI and to transparency.</p>
<p>On January 31, 2013, CIDA published its second set of quarterly IATI data files. These now include terminating and closed projects, as well as operational projects.</p>
<p>On April 30, 2013, CIDA published its third set of quarterly IATI data files. The organisation file includes two new fields, providing the sum of approved commitments to key partner countries and key organisations.</p>

<p>As a result of the amalgamation of CIDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into the new Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) in June&nbsp;2013, a new implementation schedule for DFATD may need to be developed.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2013, DFATD published the fourth set of quarterly IATI <a href="/acdi-cida/acdi-cida.nsf/eng/CAR-102915479-R82">data files</a>.</p>
